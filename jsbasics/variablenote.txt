// // varibales in JS

// Variable is a container to store values. There are certain rules to declares variables in Js:
//     1-> Always use alpabets,numbers,underscores,dollar signs as varible names
//     2-> don't use numbers as starting it will give an error
//     3-> Reserved words cannot be used as varibale names

//     There are 3 ways to declare variables:
//         1)var
//         2)let
//         3)const
    
//         var: It is a keyword while declaring variables and using of var variables we can reasssign and redeclares varibales
                // It is a global scope 
                // var a=90;
                // console.log(a); //output: 90
                // var a=89   //we can declare like var a=89 or a=89 this is called reassign and redeclare variables
                // console.log(a); //output:89


            // let: It is also keyword while declaring variables and using of let we cannot redeclare varibales 
            // but we can reassign it and it is a block scoped
            // // let a
            // // console.lo
            // // // let a=90 //we you do this gives an error as it is a block scoped we cannot redeclared it but we can reassig
            // // a=90 //this will not give you an e
            // // console.log(a)




            // Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the 
            // top of their containing scope during the compile phase. 
            // This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code.


             // console.log(a);   it will not give error but gives undefined as variable declaration  moved up but not value
            // var a=10;
             // console.log(a);



            //  The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) refers to the period from the start of a block until a 
            //  variable declared with let or const is initialized. 
            //  During this time, accessing the variable will result in a ReferenceError.


            // function example() {
            //     console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
            //     let a = 5;
            //     console.log(a); // Output: 5
            // }
            
            // example();


            // const varibale it was not constant cannot be redeclared and reassigned
